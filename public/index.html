      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tag above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

     <!--In case you're curious (and you've checked out the source for this, so of COURSE you are)
          this is actually a small React app.  "Why React?! It looks like a plain Jane Q website to me."
          You might be saying to yourself. And you're correct! It is. But this is a portfolio site and
          I can make a React app if I want to. So there!  Also, once you get your app framed up how you
          want it React makes it pretty painless to move content around without breaking stuff.
          I'll sneak in features here and there, so stay tuned.'
